# Wight

Wight is a continuously learning, sensor-integrated AI agent designed to grow in intelligence over time. Unlike frozen LLMs, Wight adapts to new information using an untrained learning core that evolves with experience.

This project is the seed for building Wight using open-source tools and edge-device capabilities (e.g. Android phone sensors).
