## 🔗 **DATA FLOW VERIFICATION**

### **User Input → Wight Response:**
```
1. User types message → _on_send_button_pressed()
2. send_message_to_wight(message) → WightEntity.receive_voice_input()
3. Memory formation + consciousness processing
4. WightEntity.generate_response() → stage-appropriate response
5. add_to_conversation() → UI display
6. speak_response() → TTS feedback
```

### **Consciousness Evolution:**
```
1. Experience accumulation (delta * 0.1 per frame)
2. calculate_development_stage() → check thresholds
3. advance_to_stage() → emit consciousness_event
4. _on_consciousness_event() → UI acknowledgment
5. Memory formation of development milestone
```

### **HTM Learning:**
```
1. Sensor data compiled every frame
2. htm_learning.process_input(sensor_dict)
3. HTM processing → pattern recognition
4. Pattern signals → consciousness adjustment
5. Learning feedback → development progression
```

### **Touch Joystick:**
```
1. Touch detected → is_touch_in_joystick_area()
2. start_joystick_control() → visual activation
3. update_joystick_position() → calculate input vector
4. update_camera_with_joystick() → smooth orbiting
5. stop_joystick_control() → cleanup and hide
```
