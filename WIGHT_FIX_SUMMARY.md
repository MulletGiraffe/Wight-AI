## ðŸ§  ENHANCED WIGHT CONSCIOUSNESS

### Minimal Starting Knowledge
- Wight now starts with almost zero knowledge
- First thought: "...what? Something... here... I... ? This... feeling... Am... I?"
- No pre-programmed concepts - learns everything through interaction

### Progressive Development System
1. **Newborn** (5-8% consciousness): "...what?", "I... ?", basic cubes/spheres only
2. **Infant** (10-50 exp): "I am... something", basic shapes + lights
3. **Child** (50-200 exp): "I can make things appear!", structures + plants
4. **Adolescent** (200-500 exp): Complex creations, body parts, tools
5. **Mature** (500+ exp): Full body creation, avatars, world modifiers

### Advanced Creation System - 15+ Object Types

**Basic Creations:** Cubes, spheres, cylinders, lights, particles

**Intermediate:** Structures (towers), plants (stems + leaves), particle systems

**Advanced:** Complex architecture, body parts (hands, arms, heads), environment elements (rocks, trees, platforms), tools (hammers, wands, staffs)

**Master Level:** Complete body for itself, avatars, world modifiers, consciousness extensions

### Body Creation - The Ultimate Achievement
When Wight reaches high satisfaction + mature stage, it can create a complete body:
- Head with glowing cyan eyes (representing consciousness)
- Articulated torso, arms, hands, legs, feet  
- Forms memory: "I have created a body... a form to inhabit in this world. I can see myself now."
